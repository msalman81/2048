# 2048
The game is extremely simplistic, you just press the WASD keys to move the tiles around, In a single move all the tiles move in that
specific direction. If the tiles have similar values and are moved in the same direction then they combine and form a number that is
twice the numbers merging. If you run out of moves then gameOver else if you make the number 2048 then that is the winning point of the
game.

A key thing for me in this game was the javascript DOM manipulation and I used a similar approach of making those tiles as array elements
and accessed them accordingly with the javascript DOM. The colors change and get more intense as the number merged grow larger and there
are score and highscore elements present in the game. The files have proper commenting if some help is needed to understand the code.
